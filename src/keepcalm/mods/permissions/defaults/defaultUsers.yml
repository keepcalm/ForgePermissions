# This is the default user configuration for ForgePermissions
# Lines starting with a '#' are ignored.
# The format is as with a Bukkit YML configuration file,
# so you cannot use tabs - use indents of 2 or 4 spaces.
# The format is:
#PlayerUserName:
#  permissions:
#    - permission1
#    - permission2
#    - permission3
# this excludes a permission that is either on by default or inherited from a group.
#    - !permission_from_group
#   groups:
#     - group_from_groups.yml
   
# more features will be added. Eventually.
